## Making an Appeal

Consult the rules on the [form of an answer](form-of-answer.md) before
filing the appeal. Answers not in a valid form will not be considered.

1. Use the meet contact information to get in touch with the chair of
   the Appeals Committee or the current President.

2. File your written appeal [on the nsml.org
website](https://nsml.org/coaches/appeals/).

See [below](#appeals-procedure) for the official details.

## Precedent-Setting Appeals

1. The committee decided categorically that it could not deal with an
   appeal having to do with an oral. To change a score, either by
   overriding a judge or by contacting the judge is a remedy worse
   than the problem. It is the function of the judge to make the best
   decision possible. We realize that there is inequity built in to
   the oral event, but have decided that the experience for the
   students is worth any problems it causes.
2. The common mathematical definition of "between" excludes the
   boundaries. If the boundaries are to be included, the word
   "inclusive" must be used.
3. A recursively defined function equivalent to the correct closed
   form function is an acceptable answer, but the initial condition
   must be given, even if it is stated in the problem. That is, the
   contestant must tell us what f(1) is as well as how to get from
   f(n) to f(n+1).

## Reponsibility for Appeals

Member schools are responsible for knowing the Leagueâ€™s
rules regarding appeals and for submitting appeals in accordance with
the rules.  The host school is not involved at all in handling
appeals, or responsible for answering questions about procedure.
Any questions about procedure can be directed to the League President.

## Appeals Procedure

Appeals should be submitted according to the following
procedure:

* **The day after the meet, inform the chairperson of the appeals
committee by phone of your intent to appeal**. You should explain the
general nature of your appeal at this time.
* Within **TWO SCHOOL DAYS** of the meet, using the "Make Appeal" link
on the NSML web site, you need to send a written appeal to the appeals
chairperson along with supportive information (a copy of the test, for
example).
* The committee will render a decision as soon as possible after
receiving the written appeal.
* In the event that the coach is not satisfied with this decision, an
appeal may be made to the league board of appeals, which consists of
one representative from each of the host schools at the contested
meet. Their decision will be final.

Appeals will not affect the outcome of a particular meet, but will affect league standings. Ribbons will be awarded to reflect the corrected scores, if necessary, but none will ever be called back.

## Reasons for Appeals

Appeals will be considered for the following reasons:

1. **Grading error**. The coach will be required to email a scan of the
   test to the statistician within two school days of the meet.
2. **Incorrect official answer**. If the appeal is granted, all coaches will be notified within two weeks of the meet and all scores for all schools will be altered to reflect the corrected answer.
3. **Reasonable alternate solution**. If the appeal is granted, only the students who filed appeals will receive credit for a correct answer. No other scores will be changed. A coach may submit one appeal on behalf of many students, but their papers must all be submitted. Scores of students who did not file an appeal will not be changed, even if they have the same answer as the student who appealed.
4. **Correct alternate form**. If the appeal is granted, the score of the contestant who appealed will be changed. No other scores will be changed. A coach may submit one appeal on behalf of many students, but their papers must all be submitted. Scores of students who did not file an appeal will not be changed, even if they have the same answer as the student who appealed.

A list of appeals (except grading errors) will be sent to coaches as
soon as possible after a meet. Any precedents established on this list
will be used to decide future appeals.
