## Making an Appeal

Consult the rules on the [form of an answer](form-of-answer.md) before
filing the appeal. Answers not in a valid form will not be considered.

1. Use the meet contact information to get in touch with the chair of
   the Appeals Committee or the current President.

2. File your written appeal [on the nsml.org
website](https://nsml.org/coaches/appeals/).

## Precedent-Setting Appeals

1. The committee decided categorically that it could not deal with an
   appeal having to do with an oral. To change a score, either by
   overriding a judge or by contacting the judge is a remedy worse
   than the problem. It is the function of the judge to make the best
   decision possible. We realize that there is inequity built in to
   the oral event, but have decided that the experience for the
   students is worth any problems it causes.
2. The common mathematical definition of "between" excludes the
   boundaries. If the boundaries are to be included, the word
   "inclusive" must be used.
3. A recursively defined function equivalent to the correct closed
   form function is an acceptable answer, but the initial condition
   must be given, even if it is stated in the problem. That is, the
   contestant must tell us what f(1) is as well as how to get from
   f(n) to f(n+1).

## Reponsibility for Appeals

Member schools are responsible for knowing the Leagueâ€™s
rules regarding appeals and for submitting appeals in accordance with
the rules.  The host school is not involved at all in handling
appeals, or responsible for answering questions about procedure.
Any questions about procedure can be directed to the League President.
