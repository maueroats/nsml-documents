# NSML Meets: General Information

This page contains the most important general information about the
contests. Detailed regulations are posted elsewhere.

## Visiting Schools

* If you are delayed or unable to attend, please inform the host
  immediately.
* **Want to bring more than 5 alternates per grade level?** Contact the
host early. Volunteer extra coaches for proctoring (if you have
them). Staff and space may make this tight. Please be understanding if
the host school cannot make this work.

## General Regulations

1. Schools on strike may not compete.
2. Students below the 9th grade may not compete as contestants, but may compete as
alternates.
4. Cell phones must be turned off and not visible during the contest.

    * If a cell phone goes off
    during a contest, the student will be disqualified.
    * If a cell phone is visible, the proctor will request that the
 student put it away.
    * If the student does not comply, the student will be
      disqualified.

   Disqualification in these circumstances means that a student will get
   a score of zero for the contest the student is taking, but otherwise
   remains eligible to compete as normal.

5. No oralist may have a cell phone or computer with them in the **sequester** or preparation rooms. An
oralist who violates this rule will be disqualified for the entire evening. Make your
proctors aware of this rule.

## Contact Information
Head coaches: It is important for the League President to have correct contact information
to reach you in case of an emergency, scoring change, or other announcement. Please
make sure that your contact information on the Leagueâ€™s website is current. Several days
before the meet, the League president will ask you by e-mail to verify your contact
information.
