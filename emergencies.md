# NSML Emergencies

## Guiding Principles and General

See the League's [philosophy statement](/philosophy) for our
guiding principles.

Rescheduling a meet is not possible; delaying the announcement of
results at the conference meet is not practical.  As fairness cannot
be served with substitute questions, all make-up questions must be the
same as the actual competition.

This policy is for situations where normal participation is not physically
possible or where concern for the safety of students and coaches prevents
normal participation.  It is imperative that all schools submit accurate
contact information to the league so that in the event of an emergency, schools
can contact one another and can be contacted by the president.

Any decision made under these rules is subject to review by the president and
the board.  These rules must be revisited after any significant application,
particularly if parts of a contest are taken after the scheduled date, with
special attention to any statistical anomalies.

Any school making habitual or apparently abusive use of this policy may be
subject to sanctions at the discretion of the board.


## Orals (edits needed)

~~Orals cannot be made up except in groups of four or more schools and must be
made up within three school days of the scheduled meet.  All arrangements,
including qualified judges, must be made by the schools involved, subject to
approval by the president.  The site and time are to be chosen by consensus of
involved schools.  (The originally assigned judges are not responsible for this
make up meet.  Involved schools must arrange to provide qualified
judges.)~~

Orals can be made up by video submission. Ideally the oralist will
make a recording of their presentation the night of the event. All
orals must be made up by the end of Friday, the week of the meet.

A school is only eligible to make up the oral if they are also
eligible to make up at least one of the two rounds of written
competition.

Coaches should direct oralists to avoid any improper contact with
oralists who have taken the contest and should emphasize the
importance of integrity to the oralist.

## Particular Situations

This section dictates the standard NSML protocol for various situations.

### School unable to get to site, stuck on the way to site

The school must keep the host school apprised of their predicament and must
contact the president before 11pm on the night of the scheduled meet.  The
school will be allowed to administer the contest at their own school, under
proper contest conditions, within three school days of the meet.  Coaches
should direct students to avoid any improper contact with students who have
taken the contest and should emphasize the importance of integrity to students
taking the make-up competition.

### School unable to get to site, stuck at home

The school must keep the host school apprised of their predicament and must
contact the president as soon as possible.  The best option is for the contest
to be sent (email, fax, etc.) to the school to be administered at home
concurrent with the scheduled meet under proper conditions, results to be sent
separately to the statisticians.  If conditions specific to the school prevent
this, follow the "unable to get to site, stuck on the way" rules.

### School arrives significantly late to site

The school must contact host as soon as possible and provide updated ETAs when
possible.  The school should abandon the trip if arrival for the
Sophomore/Senior round is not possible (allowing for a slightly delayed start
of that round at the discretion of the host).  The host school should make
every reasonable attempt to administer the contest to a late arriving school
under contest circumstances.  If this means sequestering contestants for a few
minutes, that should be done.  If host school can accommodate a somewhat
altered schedule for the late-arriving school (e.g. Freshman/Junior round run
concurrently with Sophomore/Senior round for the late school only), this should
be done.  Events missed (Freshman/Junior round only or whole meet) will be
dealt with following the "unable to get to site, stuck on the way" rules.

### Host school unable to host

The host school must contact the president as soon as possible so that schools
scheduled to compete at that host site can be notified and reassigned by the
president.  The host school is subject to the "unable to get to site, stuck at
home" rules with respect to their own team.  In particular, the host school
should monitor weather conditions in their area and alert the president of
potential problems or interruptions of the meet as soon as possible.

If the president can reassign the visiting schools by 2pm, the visiting schools
must compete as directed unless otherwise affected.  If the visiting schools
are not contacted until after 2pm, the visiting schools may compete as directed
by the president or opt to abandon the trip and follow the "unable to get to
site, stuck at home" or the "unable to get to site, stuck on the way" rules.

Host schools canceling meets habitually or in an apparently abusive manner may
be subject to sanctions at the discretion of the board.

### Participation forbidden by administration

Compete remotely on the night of the meet if possible.  Otherwise the
president and/or board of directors will need to approve taking the exam
on the next school day. Taking the exam later than that is unlikely to
be approved.

### Interruption of meet in progress

The host school should attempt to preserve and continue any event already
started (running for more than five minutes), as these cannot reasonably be
made up.  Any part(s) of the meet not held or interrupted within the first five
minutes can be made up in accordance with the "school unable to get to site,
stuck at home" rules.

### Conference Meet

In the event that the conference meet cannot be held as scheduled due to
hosting issues or prevailing conditions, or that more than one third of the
schools in the league are not in attendance, schools not attending the meet
will be permitted to take the contest following the "school unable to get to
site, stuck at home" rules.  Results will be announced one week after the
scheduled conference meet, with small awards to be mailed or shipped and large
awards to be picked up by the recipients.

If results are not delayed as specified above, any schools not in attendance
will receive a score of zero for the meet.  Results will be announced and
awards will be given at the conference meet as usual.  Schools not in
attendance may appeal to the board through the president to be allowed to make
up the meet as specified in the "school unable to get to site, stuck at home"
rules, and duplicate awards may be issued at the discretion of the board.
