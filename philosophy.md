## Philosophy

The philosophy of the league is that our top priority is to encourage
the involvement of as many students as possible in a challenging
mathematics experience while ensuring that everyone is treated
fairly. Whenever it becomes necessary to make a decision not covered
in these rules, this philosophy will be used to arrive at a decision.
