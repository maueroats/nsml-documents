See [the instructions given to the orals
contestants](hosting/orals-contestant) for the presentation rules.

## Oral Events

1. At the beginning of the contest, all oral contestants will be
sequestered. Contestants may not leave the sequester room without
permission from the host school. Fifteen minutes prior to the
presentation, the contestant will be instructed to report to the oral
preparation room and will be given a copy of the questions. There will
be three questions, each on a different sheet of paper. Fifteen
minutes are allowed for preparation. During the preparation, the
contestant may use any print or written materials. A calculator
may be allowed, depending on the contest. Laptops, phones, and
other electronic devices may not be used at any time. Notes should be
made on the question sheets or specially marked extra paper.  Only the
question sheets and specially marked paper may be used in the presentation room.
When the contestant enters the presentation
room, the timer will read the instructions aloud.

2. For Meets 1 and 2, the oral contest is an individual event. Each oral contestant must prepare and present alone. For Meets 3 and 4, a school may enter a single contestant or an oral team of two students. Each member of an oral team may, but is not required to, participate in all parts of the presentation. The students may decide how to allocate their presentation time. For example, they may “trade off” questions they answer or one student may take the lead while the other student adds information or clarification as needed. Only one student at a time may be active, either speaking or writing, during the presentation time. The other student must sit quietly and **may not write** (on paper or on the board). Neither member of an oral team at a meet may participate as a contestant in a written contest as the same meet.

3. Students and their coaches are encouraged to attend their team's oral presentation, as long as space permits. Spectators should be waiting quietly in the hall when the oralist finishes preparation. They should enter when the oralist enters, listen quietly, and leave when the presentation is done. An observer needs to will obtain permission from the oral contestant or the oral contestant’s coach before observing an oral presentation.
