# General Rules

See also the [Policy for Inclement Weather and Other Emergencies](emergencies).

1. Variations of rules requiring president or board approval must be
   requested ahead of time. No post-hoc approvals may be granted.

6. (**Move to emergencies**) In the event that a school's administration calls off all after school activities on the day of a meet, the school will have the obligation to take the written events on the first full school day after school resumes. The questions will be emailed to the school and will be administered by the coach under contest rules. The oralist can be accommodated by video recording. The details will be decided by the president.

7. If a meet is canceled due to a decision by a school's
   administration, schools scheduled to compete at that site have an
   obligation to attempt to find an alternate site. The school will
   make every reasonable effort to compete on the night of the meet,
   either at an alternative host school or remotely at their own
   school. If they demonstrate that they have tried to reschedule, in
   good faith, but have failed, they will be given the opportunity to
   administer the contest the next school day at their school,
   questions to be emailed to them, and administered, proctored and
   graded by the coach. If a school is unable to demonstrate a
   reasonable attempt to reschedule the night of the meet, they lose
   the right to make up the meet. The president will decide what is
   reasonable, the school having the option of appealing that decision
   to the board. The oralist should be accommodated by video recording
   with as little delay as possible. The details will be decided by
   the president.
