# General Rules

See also the [Policy for Inclement Weather and Other
Emergencies](emergencies) as well as the statement of [philosophy](philosophy).

1. Regulations are designed to maintain the integrity of the contest
   while keeping participation high.
2. Variations of rules requiring president or board approval must be
   requested ahead of time. No post-hoc approvals will be granted.
3. In the event of a situation not covered by the rules, the head
   coach of the host school should make a decision. Consult with the
   president of the organization if time allows.

## Written Events

1. (Contestants.) Each school may enter a maximum of five contestants at each event
   during league contests. Five contestants are allowed at the
   conference meet. The top three scores will count.

2. (Alternates.) Each team may
   designate additional students as alternates to take the test for
   the experience, except at the conference meet.

   * Host schools will accommodate at least five alternates per team
   per event.
   * Alternates' scores will not be counted towards the team's total,
   but their scores will be recorded and reported for individual
   records. An alternate with a perfect score will receive a ribbon.
   * A school may bring more than five alternates if permission is
   granted by the host school. Requests should be made at least two
   days in advance of the meet.

3. (Designation of contestants.) The official designation of students as contestants or alternates will be determined by the official online roster sheet submitted before the meet by the coach. A coach may not change the designation of a student on the team roster after the first five minutes of the respective event.

3. (Format and scores.)
   There will be four written tests at each meet, one at each grade
   level. Each test will consist of five questions, worth a total of
   25 points. Questions 1 and 2 will each be worth 4 points, question
   3 will be worth 5 points, and questions 4 and 5 will be worth 6
   points each. No partial credit will be given. All answers must meet
   the following specifications unless instructions on the exam state
   otherwise.

   * Answers must be clearly written in the answer blank provided.
   * See specific rules on the [allowed forms of answers](form-of-answer).

4. (Testing protocol.)
   * The freshman and junior competitions begin at 6:15; the sophomore and senior competitions begin at 7:00.
   * Tests will be
   passed out face down.
   * Each test will be exactly thirty minutes in length.
   * If a student arrives late, the student is not given extra time at the end.
   * The person in charge will tell the
   contestants to turn their papers over and write their name and
   school on top, and then begin timing.
   * If no clock is visible, the person in charge will announce when
    fifteen minutes remain.
   * The person in charge will announce when five minutes remain.
   * When time is up, the person in charge announces the end of the
     contest and tells students to hold their papers in the air while
     they are collected.

5. (Materials.)
   The only materials students may use during the contest are: pens or
   pencils, erasers, calculators, and extra batteries. Scratch
   paper will be provided.

   Some contests may be designated as no calculator contests. Consult
   the list of topics.

   A student may use at most three calculators. Battery or solar
   powered calculators are allowed.

   A student may use a paper foreign
   language dictionary. If desired, the host school may examine the
   dictionary to ensure that it is just a dictionary and does not
   contain formulas or other content that would give the student an
   unfair advantage.

   "All electronic devices except for
   contest-approved calculators must be turned off and out of sight
   during contests." We will disqualify the scores of students
   violating this rule.

6. (Issues with questions.)
   Once a test has begun, no problems will be altered and no questions will be answered. If a problem is impossible because it is underdetermined or overdetermined, the correct answer is "the problem is impossible." If a problem is ambiguous, the contestant should select what seems to be the best interpretation and solve it.

7. (Appeals.)
Coaches should keep all tests for two weeks after the contests in case
of appeal. The [appeals procedure](appeals) is explained in a separate
document.

8. (Competing at two levels.)
Students may compete in more than one event at each meet.  However, it
is the philosophy of the league that as many students as possible
participate.  As such, no student should be left at home so that
another student may compete at two levels.  Students may compete above
their grade level but not below it. No one may compete as a contestant
in both the oral and written events at a given meet.

## Oral Events

1. At the beginning of the contest, all oral contestants will be
sequestered. Contestants may not leave the sequester room without
permission from the host school. Fifteen minutes prior to the
presentation, the contestant will be instructed to report to the oral
preparation room and will be given a copy of the questions. There will
be three questions, each on a different sheet of paper. Fifteen
minutes are allowed for preparation. During the preparation, the
contestant may use any print or written materials. A calculator
may be allowed, depending on the contest. Laptops, phones, and
other electronic devices may not be used at any time. Notes should be
made on the question sheets or specially marked extra paper.  Only the
question sheets and specially marked paper may be used in the presentation room.
When the contestant enters the presentation
room, the timer will read the instructions aloud.

2. For Meets 1 and 2, the oral contest is an individual event. Each oral contestant must prepare and present alone. For Meets 3 and 4, a school may enter a single contestant or an oral team of two students. Each member of an oral team may, but is not required to, participate in all parts of the presentation. The students may decide how to allocate their presentation time. For example, they may “trade off” questions they answer or one student may take the lead while the other student adds information or clarification as needed. Only one student at a time may be active, either speaking or writing, during the presentation time. The other student must sit quietly and **may not write** (on paper or on the board). Neither member of an oral team at a meet may participate as a contestant in a written contest as the same meet.

3. Students and their coaches are encouraged to attend their team's oral presentation, as long as space permits. Spectators should be seated in the room before the presentation begins and should remain quietly seated until it is completed. It is expected that an observer will obtain permission from the oral contestant or the oral contestant’s coach before observing an oral presentation.

## Conference Meet

The format of events at the conference meet is different from other meets. In particular:
* No alternates are allowed.
* No orals at the conference meet.
