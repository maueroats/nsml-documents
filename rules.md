# General Rules

See also the [Policy for Inclement Weather and Other
Emergencies](emergencies) as well as the statement of [philosophy](philosophy).

1. Regulations are designed to maintain the integrity of the contest
   while keeping participation high.
2. Variations of rules requiring president or board approval must be
   requested ahead of time. No post-hoc approvals will be granted.
3. In the event of a situation not covered by the rules, the head
   coach of the host school should make a decision. Consult with the
   president of the organization if time allows.

## Written Events

1. (Contestants.) Each school may enter a maximum of five contestants at each event
   during league contests. Five contestants are allowed at the
   conference meet. The top three scores will count.

2. (Alternates.) Each team may
   designate additional students as alternates to take the test for
   the experience, except at the conference meet.

   * Host schools will accommodate at least five alternates per team
   per event.
   * Alternates' scores will not be counted towards the team's total,
   but their scores will be recorded and reported for individual
   records. An alternate with a perfect score will receive a ribbon.
   * A school may bring more than five alternates if permission is
   granted by the host school. Requests should be made at least two
   days in advance of the meet.

3. (Designation of contestants.) The official designation of students as contestants or alternates will be determined by the official online roster sheet submitted before the meet by the coach. A coach may not change the designation of a student on the team roster after the first five minutes of the respective event.

3. (Format and scores.)
   There will be four written tests at each meet, one at each grade
   level. Each test will consist of five questions, worth a total of
   25 points. Questions 1 and 2 will each be worth 4 points, question
   3 will be worth 5 points, and questions 4 and 5 will be worth 6
   points each. No partial credit will be given. All answers must meet
   the following specifications unless instructions on the exam state
   otherwise.

   * Answers must be clearly written in the answer blank provided.
   * See specific rules on the [allowed forms of answers](form-of-answer).

4. (Testing protocol.)
   * The freshman and junior competitions begin at 6:15; the sophomore and senior competitions begin at 7:00.
   * Tests will be
   passed out face down so that no questions are visible.
   * Each test will be exactly thirty minutes in length.
   * If a student arrives late, the student is not given extra time at the end.
   * The person in charge will tell the
   contestants to turn their papers over and write their name and
   school on top, and then begin timing.
   * If no clock is visible, the person in charge will announce when
    fifteen minutes remain.
   * The person in charge will announce when five minutes remain.
   * When time is up, the person in charge announces the end of the
     contest and tells students to hold their papers in the air while
     they are collected.

5. (Materials.)
   The only materials students may use during the contest are: pens or
   pencils, erasers, calculators, and extra batteries. Scratch
   paper will be provided.

   A student violating the rules governing electronic devices will be
   disqualified. ("All electronic devices except for contest-approved
   calculators must be turned off and out of sight during contests.")

   A student may use a paper or offline electronic foreign language
   dictionary. If electronic, the student should demonstrate the
   capabilities to the proctor.
   It must not contain formulas or other content that would give the
   student an unfair advantage.

6. (Issues with questions.)
   Once a test has begun, no problems will be altered and no questions will be answered. If a problem is impossible because it is underdetermined or overdetermined, the correct answer is "the problem is impossible." If a problem is ambiguous, the contestant should select what seems to be the best interpretation and solve it.

7. (Appeals.)
Coaches should keep all tests for two weeks after the contests in case
of appeal. The [appeals procedure](appeals) is explained in a separate
document.

8. (Competing at two levels.)
Students may compete in more than one event at each meet.  However, it
is the philosophy of the league that as many students as possible
participate.  As such, no student should be left at home so that
another student may compete at two levels.  Students may compete above
their grade level but not below it. No one may compete as a contestant
in both the oral and written events at a given meet.

## Conference Meet

The format of events at the conference meet is different from other meets. In particular:
* No alternates are allowed.
* No orals at the conference meet.
