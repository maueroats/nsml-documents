# Awards

This page details the awards for each meet, as well as the overall
awards given at the conference meet.

## Meet Awards

Ribbons are awarded for the entire team, not just "contestants".

* Written event ribbons: first place (blue), second place (red).

* Perfect score ribbons (gold): all perfect scores, including orals.

* Orals event ribbons: green (first place), white (second place).

In case of ties, duplicate ribbons will be awarded.

## Season Awards

1. Plaques will be awarded at the end of each season to the top three
   schools at each division at each grade level (and orals), as
   determined by total points at that level. No grade level trophies
   will be awarded.

2. At the conclusion of the season, trophies will be awarded to the
   top N schools as determined by total points, where N is the number
   of schools in the top division. Ties will be broken by considering
   the score at the conference meet. Other tiebreakers will be added
   as needed. Duplicate awards will be presented only for
   orals. Plaques will be awarded to the top three schools in each
   division.

3. An Improvement trophy will be awarded to the three schools that
   improve in places the most. In case of a tie, the team whose total
   score improved the most from the previous year will receive the
   award.

4. Twelve certificates will be included in the Conference meet packet
   of each grade level team (4 for orals) that finishes in the top 5
   in overall league standings. These should be completed by the coach
   and distributed to deserving team members.
