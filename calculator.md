**NSML competitions do not allow calculators.**

This change was made in 2024 based on several factors, including:

1. Some school districts are moving to online calculators like
   Desmos. Students in those districts will no longer own traditional
   calculators.
2. Other school districts require their students to purchase
   calculators with computer algebra systems.
3. Computer algebra systems have become so powerful that they reduce
   problem solving to a typing exercise.

# Calculators (Legacy)

~~If a calculator is on the current list of approved graphing
calculators on the College Board's [AP Exams Calculator
Policy](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies#list),
then it is legal for NSML competition use.~~

~~Frosh and Sophomore level contests currently forbid calculators with
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), which will exclude some of the
calculators on the list.~~

~~Rules for all calculators are:~~

* ~~Calculators must be battery or solar powered.~~
* ~~Calculators may not have printouts.~~
* ~~A student may use at most three calculators.~~
