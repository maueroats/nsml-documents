# Calculators

If a calculator is on the current list of approved graphing
calculators on the College Board's [AP Exams Calculator
Policy](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies#list),
then it is legal for NSML competition use.

Frosh and Sophomore level contests currently forbid calculators with
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), which will exclude some of the
calculators on the list.

This policy is currently under review.
