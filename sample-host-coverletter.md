Hello  Coaches,

We are looking forward to hosting the next NSML competition at (school
name) on (date).  We are located at (address) in (city).

Everybody knows you never know how many kids you will have until they are on the bus.  But **will you please let me know about how many total students you might have at each level as soon as you can.**  Bring all of your alternates!

If you enter the main entrance (off the front circle drive) and go left past the security desk, posted signs will direct you to homerooms on the first floor.  Competition takes place in the same wing, 2nd floor.

After the meet, it would be an easy pick up if your bus met you at the Studio Theater entrance at the back (north) of the building.

(School A) and (School B) will be our oral judges.

I have [attached the schedule][1] for the meet. There will be munchies for coaches!

Let me know if you have any questions.  If you need to reach us on meet night by phone, here are a couple of numbers you can try:

Math Office:  (number)

My cell:  (number)

Other coach's cell (name):  (number)  (your best bet!)
