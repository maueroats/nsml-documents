# Host Instructions for NSML Meets

## About one month in advance of the contest

1. Reserve rooms in your school. You will need a minimum of:
    * Four rooms for written events, or space to hold at least 100 contestants. (Five
contestants and five alternates for each of five schools and two grade levels at a time.)
    * Three rooms for orals: one room for sequestering, one room for preparation, and one
room for presentation. Make sure the presentation room has sufficient board space.
    * One homeroom per school. Typical classrooms are appropriate.
    * One “headquarters” room for grading (for example, a classroom or department office).
    * One large room or space for presenting awards. This space needs to hold about 200
people.
    * Several unlocked washrooms.
    * A school might want to bring more than five alternates at a
      grade level. It is up to the host to decide whether to accommodate the school.
2. Order refreshments for coaches.
3. Make refreshment arrangements for students, if feasible.
4. Decide on prizes for the 20-question event. (Candy bars are a big favorite.) Most schools
bring between 20 and 30 students, but there could be 40 or more. Use your own judgment
and resources to decide how much to get.
5. Prepare documents to send to the head coaches of the schools competing at your site.
These documents should include:
     1. a schedule of contest start times (including the oral
contest draw);
     2. a map with directions to your school;
     3. a statement about cafeteria space availability and/or food in rooms; and
     4. a statement indicating whether schools are limited to five
        alternates per written event or may bring more.

   It is
desirable to determine the order of the oral presentations through a random draw in the
presence of the contestants on the night of the contest. You may, however, include an oral
timetable with the schedule. In either case, the selection process must be random.
6. Instructions pertaining to the oral contest:
The orals will be sent in two forms: a three-page contestant form and a one page judge’s
form. You will need to copy an adequate number of both. _It is critical that the
contestants get the three-page form._
7. Assign faculty to be in charge of the various events. You will need a minimum of:

   * Written rooms: One proctor for each room.
   * Oral rooms: Two proctors—one for sequestering and preparation and one timer in
the presentation room.
   * Grading: Three to five people to grade, double-check the grading, fill out score
sheets and ribbons, and stuff envelopes.
   * Data Entry: Two people to enter scores. One person could also be a grader. It is
imperative that the scores be entered correctly, so two pairs of eyes on this is a
must.

   Make efforts to ensure that all proctors understand the rules of the contest and how each
event should be run. In particular, make sure written proctors understand the rules
regarding instructions given before the contest begins, time announcements, and questions
for contestants. Be sure the timer for the orals understands the oral rules and knows to
read the "script" to each contestant as he/she enters.
8. The League will provide host schools with ribbons at the beginning of the year. Check to
see that you have them.
9. Prepare a folder or large envelope for each event. Place a sufficient number of question
sheets in them. Also include a copy of the instructions for the proctor. Supply each
proctor with blank scratch paper.
10. Prepare 10" x 13" or larger envelopes labeled for each school for stuffing the night of the
contest. Include in these envelopes a complete set of the questions and answers.

## Monday the week before the week of the contest

1. Make sure you have sent an email the head coaches of all schools
attending. Include the schedule and other items mentioned above.

2. This gives coaches time to get permission slips to students at the
practice before the "meet week" if needed.

## A few days before the night of the contest

1. Copying Question Sets: Contest questions and answer keys will be sent to head coaches a
few days prior to the contest via e-mail attachments. As the host school, you will need to
duplicate the question sets in numbers sufficient for all participants and alternates. If there
are any last minute changes to either the questions or the answers, you will be notified via
phone or e-mail by the League President or other member of the NSML Board. At all
times prior to the contest, keep questions and answers secure and out of plain view.
2. Checking for Errors: The head coach should ask a trustworthy, non-math team math
teacher to review printed versions of the e-mail attachments for transmission and copy
errors only. The most common kind of error is an obvious corruption of
a diagram (e.g., labels of points disappear or come out as
symbols). _Compare the printed version to the online version_ to catch these.
**It is inappropriate for a coach or anyone else at the host school to review or
work through the problems before the contest.** The questions have been proofread, and if
there is an error, we will deal with it on the night of the meet.

## The night of the contest

1. Post signs to direct arriving students to their homerooms, or arrange for student guides.
2. Double check question packets for each proctor.
3. Place in written rooms (or give to proctors) scratch paper and extra pencils.
4. Make sure refreshments for students and coaches are ready.
5. Make sure the oral room has necessary equipment, such as a timer, chalk/markers and
eraser, and any special equipment needed for the particular topic (e.g. construction
material, overhead projector and pens, etc.).
6. From the website, print out a copy of each team’s roster and place it in the home room
with instructions on where to go to edit the rosters.
7. Each visiting team should be given access to a computer (it can be the same one in the
grading room) where they can edit their roster.
8. Under League rules, an oralist, or member of an oral contest team, may compete as an
alternate in a written event, but may not compete as a contestant in a written event. Check
rosters to ensure that oralists are not competing as contestants on written events.
9. No roster changes are permitted after the first contest begins.
10. Grade papers, double-check grading, and stuff school envelopes with their tests and a
complete set of questions and answers.
11. After each of the written exams has begun, the host school should deliver to each
homeroom a copy of the exams being given and their answers. Be careful to not disclose
answers to written events not yet taken that night.
12. After the contests have been graded, scores must be entered at the NSML web site. Log in as the host school and see the "Hosting" tab.
13. Try to start the awards presentation as soon as possible. Displaying results on a large
screen (with a little drama) works very well. In any case, the presentation need not last
more than 10 minutes.
14. Save extra ribbons and return them to the NSML Ribbon Coordinator at the annual
coaches meeting.

## Appeals

In general, the host school is not involved at all in handling
appeals. See [general meet instructions](meet-instructions.md).
The case of an obviously wrong answer on the official answer sheet is
handled specially. If you
suspect this to be the case: (1) check your texts and email (it may
already be handled); (2) call the League President or Appeals
Committee Chair on his/her cell phone.
~~If you
are unable to reach either person, and the situation requires an immediate decision, the host
school has the final authority to decide.~~

When in doubt about a situation, take action
that allows for a later decision either way. (For example, allow a
student to finish taking the contest when their eligibility is in doubt.)

Current contact information for the Appeals Committee Chair and League President will be
sent to host schools by e-mail several days before the meet date.

## Unusual Events

Although the League tries to anticipate problems, there is always a chance of something
unusual happening that is not explicitly covered in the rules or instructions. As the host, you
are authorized to make decisions the night of the contest to handle any such situation that may
arise. The League will go along with your decision. Consulting the coaches of the visiting
schools and arriving at a mutual consensus is, of course, desirable, but if a consensus cannot
be reached and a decision must be made, the host school has the final authority the night of
the contest to do what she or he thinks is best.
