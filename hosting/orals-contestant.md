# NSML Orals Instructions

Welcome to the orals judging room. During your presentation, you may
only refer to the notes you have made on the question sheets you were
given at the beginning of the contest. Use of a calculator, text, or
other notes during your presentation is prohibited.

You have ten minutes of uninterrupted time to answer the questions. I
will give a verbal warning that "two minutes" are left and when "one
minute" is left. At the end of ten minutes, I will say "time to
stop". Please finish your sentence and then stop.

## Two Presenters

Only one person at a time may present. The other may not write or work while the first person talks.

## Closing

Please write your name and your schoolâ€™s name on the board. Then I
will begin timing.
